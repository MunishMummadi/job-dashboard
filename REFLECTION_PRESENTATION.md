## Slide 2: Challenges: Defining the User (30s)

*   **Key Challenge(s):** The primary challenge was translating the general concept of a "job seeker" into a specific user profile with defined needs for the application's scope. We needed to make assumptions about their technical familiarity (standard web browsing) and their core goal (finding relevant jobs and tracking applications efficiently).
*   **Overcoming Challenges:** We focused on the core 'Job Seeker' role as defined in the project context, assuming they needed a clear, actionable interface to filter listings and manage saved jobs, leveraging common job board paradigms.

## Slide 3: Challenges: Determining Needs (1 min)

*   **Arrival Process:** We determined the user's decision-making needs through brainstorming common job seeker tasks and analyzing the core requirements of finding, exploring, and tracking job opportunities.
*   **Key Challenge(s):** Translating the high-level goal ("find a relevant job") into specific, actionable features like multi-faceted filtering (location, company, skills, salary) and a mechanism for saving/tracking applications (`My Applications`) was a key challenge. Prioritizing these features and ensuring they were technically feasible within the project constraints also required careful consideration.
*   **Overcoming Challenges:** We addressed this by defining core user responsibilities (Find, Explore, Track) and mapping them directly to application features: the `JobList` with its filtering capabilities, the `Explore` page for company discovery, and the `My Applications` section powered by `ApplicationsContext` and `localStorage`.

## Slide 4: Challenges: Data Validation & Prep (1 min)

*   **Key Challenge(s):** A significant challenge involved working with the assumed data structure (`Job` interface). This included handling potentially missing or inconsistent data (e.g., `Company_Logo` requiring validation with `getValidLogoUrl`), parsing unstructured data within descriptions (e.g., extracting `Salary` and `Skill` using regex in `extractSalary` and `extractSkills`), and ensuring data loaded correctly from `localStorage` for the `ApplicationsProvider`.
*   **Overcoming Challenges:** We tackled these by defining a clear `Job` interface in `lib/data.ts`, creating utility functions for robust data handling (like `getValidLogoUrl`, `extractSalary`, `extractSkills`, `formatDate`, `extractWorkType`), implementing fallback mechanisms for missing data (like default logos), and adding basic validation for data loaded from `localStorage`.
*   **Curriculum Help:** Talk about information retrieval course.

## Slide 5: Challenges: UI Design (1 min)

*   **Key Challenge(s):** Designing an intuitive and effective user interface presented challenges in selecting appropriate components (e.g., `Card` for job summaries, `Select` for filters) from a library (like shadcn/ui), implementing responsive and interactive filtering logic within the `JobList` component, and managing shared application state (specifically, the list of saved applications) across different parts of the application using `ApplicationsContext` and persisting it with `localStorage`. Ensuring interactions like the "Add" button state reflected the current application status (`isJobApplied`) was also key.
*   **Overcoming Challenges:** We addressed these by utilizing a component library (shadcn/ui) for consistency and pre-built elements, leveraging the React Context API (`ApplicationsContext`) for effective state management, using `localStorage` for client-side persistence of saved jobs, and carefully designing component interactions within `JobList` and related pages.
*   **Curriculum Help:** Talk about mobile and web application course.

## Slide 6: Final Reflection (3 min 30s) - Part 1: Process

*   **Project Charter & Problem Definition:**
    *   We learned the importance of starting with a clear problem description but being flexible enough to refine the scope as technical implementation progressed. Initially a broad "job dashboard," it solidified around core features: robust filtering (`JobList`), company exploration (`Explore`), and application tracking (`My Applications`). We managed scope by focusing development on these key, achievable features.
*   **Teamwork:**
    *   Describe *your team's* communication methods (e.g., regular virtual meetings via gmeet, asynchronous chat on slack, frequency of check-ins).
    *   Explain *how you coordinated* tasks (Git, Github, trello).
    *   Describe the role played by each team member-Discuss among yourself.
    *   Explain how these roles were assigned (e.g., based on prior experience, interest, team discussion, volunteering).

## Slide 7: Final Reflection (3 min 30s) - Part 2: Learning & Growth

*   **Acquiring Knowledge:**
    *   Our approach involved diving into official documentation (React, Next.js, TypeScript, shadcn/ui), following targeted tutorials for specific challenges (like state management with Context API or data parsing), and iterative experimentation. We learned about the job search domain by analyzing common job board features.
    *   Official documentation, specific online tutorials (mention specific sites if relevant), Stack Overflow, and hands-on coding/debugging were most helpful. Pair programming (if used) could also be mentioned.
    *   Iterative development and testing worked well, allowing us to catch issues early. Sometimes initial approaches to state management or data handling needed refactoring (what didn't work), which led to exploring better solutions like the Context API or refined utility functions.
*   **Self-Efficacy (Individual Learnings):**
    *   *(Each team member should briefly reflect here)*
    *   What did *you* learn about *your* approach to tackling unfamiliar technical concepts or libraries?
    *   What did *you* learn about *your* collaboration style, handling disagreements, dividing work, and ensuring accountability?
    *   How did *your* ability to estimate task effort evolve? Were initial estimates accurate? What did you learn about group estimation?
